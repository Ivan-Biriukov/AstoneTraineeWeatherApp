## Technical requirements for the project (Apple native weather):
- CollectionView usage;
- code layout;
- 2-3 screens;
- Network request (network service implementation);
- Data storage (UserDefaults, CoreData - at your discretion);
- Geolocation (desirable, for weather - mandatory);
- MVP architecture, MVVM or VIPER, Clean - as you prefer, the main thing is not MVC;
- There will be no questions to the design, at least b/w, but the main thing is to try to comply with the general guidelines;
- Accepted dependencies: SnapKit, Alamofire, Realm can be used instead of CoreData.

## Project App Info:
- The following two figma design templates were used as the basis for the design: [first design template](https://www.figma.com/file/JbzBmfzscmaqxhCaYmztz0/Weather-app-(Community)?type=design&node-id=1-18&mode=design&t=eHsBicRneEdUMgLu-0) , [second design template](https://www.figma.com/file/zNtOa4OkrV167tJRb9zFnh/weather-app-(Community)?type=design&node-id=5-64&mode=design&t=Mw4C2e9sDLw3fbs2-0);
- A dependency on KingFisher has been added to optimize the handling of downloadable background images;
- The project was implemented as part of the practical confirmation of programming skills, as well as an indicator of understanding of the learned information, within the online intensives of the Aston IOS Trainee program.
